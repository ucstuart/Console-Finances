# Console-Finances
UoB Console Finances Week 4 Challenge

## Introduction

In this challenge I have used the oppottunity to learn about functions, import and export features and starting to create a library of reusable functions. 

I have documented the code well, and I have also used a variable to set P for Production or T for testing, when testing is set there is more output in the console log, very useful for debugging.

## Final Notes

I am aware the last two elements on the tasks do not work, this is because I had some issues on the learning about functions, and I have identified an issue with the sum of the total difference, which meant that I went around in circles for a while on the Max and Min difference. 

The debugging and P/T environment variable helped me identify this.
